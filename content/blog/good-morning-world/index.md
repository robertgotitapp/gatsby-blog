This is my first trial with GatsbyJS. It is very exciting so far
Using the fake blog provided, I am actually working on my first real blog post in years. So I would say this is a successful trial

Yeah, I am thinking about many exciting things to try with Gatsby. Give me some ideas or just come in and check out the next dumb thing I am trying out

Last thing, a good blog post should at least inludes a quote to be qualified as good so here is one:
"If you are stuck, you just gotta get out there and untie you or else what do you do" - My wise friend
